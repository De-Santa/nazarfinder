This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Definition

This project is a small project I'm trying to maintain as much as possible. 
I've made it to help people who play the game __Red dead redemption 2 Online__ - In this game you can get different "jobs" including "collector" - You need to collect items and eventually sell them to a NPC, you can also buy item from this NPC. 

The "problem" is that this NPC is on a 24h constant rotation, meaning that every day, the NPC location changes. 

This tool aims to detect the NPC's position as soon as possible, and display the information on a website.
